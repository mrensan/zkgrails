== Long-Term Support ==
While a major version of ZKGrails will be released publicly every 4 months, the release cycle of LTS versions is far shorter! An LTS (milestone and bug fixing) release will be available in the LTS repository every 2 weeks.

To access the private LTS repository, we offer the following subscription plans.
  * *$180* per 1-month per named contact.
  * *$350* per 2-month per named contact.
  * *$650* per 4-month per named contact.
  * *$1,899* per year per named contact.
This service includes premium technical support via email.
