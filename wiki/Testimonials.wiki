  "I've done two so far with great success & joy - both closed source and in active use. IMHO ZKGrails definitely *is* ready for production."


*_Gustavo Madruga_*
  "Developing our comercial app with zk-grails since 2009.
  Simplicity of zkgrails on front-end, and grails nicities (GORM, spring, all the ready-to-use plugins, etc) make our dev cycle much shorter, been able to provide value to our customers at a fast rate!"
